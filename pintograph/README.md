# Pintograph simulator

This is a pintograph simulator inspired by [Alfred Hoehn's](https://www.youtube.com/user/alfredhoehn) machines.

## Usage

See it in action on <https://michaldudak.github.io/pintograph/demo>. This page shows a couple of examples that can be a starting point for your own setups.

I am working on an online editor that will allow creating drawings without writing a single line of code. However, it is not ready to be shared yet.

## Acknowledgements

Kudos to [Fran McConville](http://www.fxmtech.com/harmonog.html) for a pintograph description and a spreadsheet with calculations. I made several changes to the original calculation methods but it was a huge help for me.

The multi-wheel drawing machine was inspired by [Robert Balke Zeichenmaschinen](https://www.facebook.com/balke.zeichenmaschinen).
