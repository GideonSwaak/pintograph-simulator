# Changelog

## 0.2.0

Massive overhaul of the whole library:

* Renamed contraptions:
  * CircularDrive, DoubleCircularDrive -> Wheel
  * SimplePen, RainbowPen -> Pen
  * SimpleArms -> VArm
  * CrossArms -> XArm
* Added new contraption: Oscillator
* Replaced Simulation object with Scene
* Removed the demo editor (a full-fledged editor is in the making)
* Introduced the concept of mount points, so contraptions can be mounted on top of each other without limits (other than processing power and available memory, of course)

This is still a work in progress and many APIs can and will change in the upcoming releases as the editor takes shape.

A better documentation will be prepared when the library is in more or less stable state.

## 0.1.3

* Fixed problems when importing the library as ES modules.

## 0.1.2

* Added readme, license and changelog to package contents.

## 0.1.1

Initial published version.
